GitHub is a web-based version of Git software. Git provides version control for coding projects and is very useful. 

The usage of Git is a bit hard to learn, but with GitHub, there is a relatively nice user interface using a web browser.

The project is called a "repository" - all versions that have been saved to the repository can be pulled out and used as needed: so if your code worked yesterday but suddenly stopped working, you can pull yesterday's version, as long as you saved it to the repository. 

We haven't learned about the Linux system yet, but I will put a few simple commands here for future reference:

git clone https://github.com/jonnynuke/summer-coding-project.git
This clones the repository into your working folder, creating your own copy.

git pull
This pulls the latest version of the repository - so if I've changed something, this is the command you'll use to get that update

If you are using a repository that you have "push" privileges in, you can write your own changes and save them to the repository.
