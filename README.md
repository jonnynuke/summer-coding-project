# summer-coding-project
This project is to learn some basic computer knowledge that should be useful for you.
The main tools we will learn about are:
1.) version control - github is our version control
2.) Linux system familiarity - learn how to navigate and do basic work in Linux. We will use the system installed at the lab
3.) basic scripting using Python 3. 
If desired, we can learn a bit about c++ after these goals.
